<center><h1><b> Hi, Welcome to Sebastian Ghapgharan's engineering website :) </b></h1></center>
<center><h2>Below you can find my reports for each week of engineering class.</h2><center>
<h3>Week 1: This week in engineering class we worked on getting our websites up and running. Also on Friday we did an activity where 9 people had to hold half pipes and roll a marble succesfully into a bucked about 30 feet away.There were many challenges while trying to get the marble into the bucket using the pipes. One challenges include people slanting the pipes to low, which caused the ball to pop out.</h3>
 
<h4>Week 2: This week in engineering class we as a class, reviewed slides on how to make Rube Goldberg Machine. We also started drawing ideas for the Rube Goldberg Machine; after we compared our drawings within our groups and decided on a final design.Laslty we took a saftey quiz in class. </h4>

<h5>Week 3: This week in engineering class we worked on finalizing our design for the Rube Goldberg Machine. We kept our design mostly the same; we had to make a minor adjustment at the end of our ramp/walls. We cut down the ramp and walls a bit so that the ballon would pop.Before we made this change the car would go under the ballon causing it not to pop. Overall our design was a success. This weeks challenge was to draw a perfect E by hand using a ruler. The purpose of this was to gain experience perfectly in making precice mesuarments, labing mesuarments correctly, and cut out our objects perfeclty.  </h5>

<h6>Week 4: This week in engineering class we worked on making a paper boat as our challenge for this week. We were only allowed to use one pice of paper to create a boat that floats and supports weights. My group chose a boat design that has a traditional boat shape.The gaal of the boat was it to last 5 minitues or longer in water with the weights added. My groups boat lasted 5 minitues, with weights. Another groups boat that stood out was one that was designed with large surface area,high walls, and even distibuted weights. This boat lasted more than 5 minitues. After seeing many different boat types in action I have come to the conclusion that the best boat design is one will high walls,large surface area, and even distributed weights.    </h6>
  
<h7>Week 5: This week we finnalized testing on our rube gold machines, we had a slight issue where the car would not hit the ballon. We made minor adjustments to the design and it kept on working after that. When we were conducting our test, Ms.Petrosian took a video of our project in action. After she aridropped that video to me, and now I will work on incopretaing it in my website. In addtion we went to Mr.Kim's class next door to see some of his students projects;there projects were quiet different from ours. Mr.Kim also visted our clas and checked out some projects.  </h7>



<h8>Week 6: This week in class we started learning about computer engineering! We had a guest speaker who workes at Western Digital as a Computer Engineer. He gave us a little bit of a more in dept intro about diffefent computer parts such as the cpu,ssd,and pci slot. He explained to us the diffent little parts of those components; I asked him how do you increase the performance of your ssd's year over year, and his response was they shrunk down the transistors, and optomized the software to gain a significant gain in performance. After his presentation our class started our computer disection lab. I would say the most challengeing part about the discetion was keeping track of the little screws inside our plastic square. Another challenge that my partner and I faced was pulling off the entire plastic frame of the laptop. I leaned that it is best to slowly pry off the frame starting from the edges, then slowly making sure that all the clips holding down the frame were not conncected anymore, so we don't case damage. Overall I really enjoyed the computer engineering segment of class!  </h8>
