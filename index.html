<center><h1><b> Hi, Welcome to Sebastian Ghapgharan's engineering website :) </b></h1></center>
<center><h2>Below you can find my reports for each week of engineering class.</h2><center>
<h3>Week 1: This week in engineering class we worked on getting our websites up and running. Also on Friday we did an activity where 9 people had to hold half pipes and roll a marble succesfully into a bucked about 30 feet away.There were many challenges while trying to get the marble into the bucket using the pipes. One challenges include people slanting the pipes to low, which caused the ball to pop out.</h3>
 
<h4>Week 2: This week in engineering class we as a class, reviewed slides on how to make Rube Goldberg Machine. We also started drawing ideas for the Rube Goldberg Machine; after we compared our drawings within our groups and decided on a final design.Laslty we took a saftey quiz in class. </h4>

<h5>Week 3: This week in engineering class we worked on finalizing our design for the Rube Goldberg Machine. We kept our design mostly the same; we had to make a minor adjustment at the end of our ramp/walls. We cut down the ramp and walls a bit so that the ballon would pop.Before we made this change the car would go under the ballon causing it not to pop. Overall our design was a success. This weeks challenge was to draw a perfect E by hand using a ruler. The purpose of this was to gain experience perfectly in making precice mesuarments, labing mesuarments correctly, and cut out our objects perfeclty.  </h5>
